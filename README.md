This game is a simpler version of Hangman.

Requirements:
----------------
Initialize your array list with the following words:
- tree
- rain
- bear
- encourage
- promise
- soup
- chess
- insurance
- pancakes
- stream

When you run the application, randomly choose a word from that list for the user to guess.

For each letter the user guesses wrong, let them know along with how many wrong guesses they have left.

The user is allowed up to 5 wrong guesses. On the 6th wrong guess, they lose the game.

If the user guesses correctly, output the word with the letters they have guessed correctly so far and blanks for letters they have not guessed yet.

The user can input either a letter or a word for their guess.

If the user guesses the word correctly, output "You've won!" and end the game.
